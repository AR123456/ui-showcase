        <b>Step by Step</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Stand in om pose. Bend your knees slightly, lift your left foot up
            and, balancing on your right foot, cross your left thigh over the
            right. Point your left toes toward the floor, press the foot back,
            and then hook the top of the foot behind the lower right calf.
            Balance on the right foot.
          </li>

          <li>
            Stretch your arms straight forward, parallel to the floor, and
            spread your scapulas wide across the back of your torso. Cross the
            arms in front of your torso so that the right arm is above the left,
            then bend your elbows. Snug the right elbow into the crook of the
            left, and raise the forearms perpendicular to the floor. The backs
            of your hands should be facing each other.
          </li>

          <li>
            Press the right hand to the right and the left hand to the left, so
            that the palms are now facing each other. The thumb of the right
            hand should pass in front of the little finger of the left. Now
            press the palms together (as much as is possible for you), lift your
            elbows up, and stretch the fingers toward the ceiling.
          </li>

          <li>
            Stay for 15 to 30 seconds, then unwind the legs and arms and stand
            in Tadasana again. Repeat for the same length of time with the arms
            and legs reversed.

        <h4>
          For Garudasana (Eagle Pose) you need strength, flexibility, and
          endurance, but also unwavering concentration that actually calms the
          fluctuations (vrtti) of consciousness. This is true of all the yoga
          poses, but it’s a bit more obvious in pretzel-like Eagle.
        </h4>
        <p>
          <i>(gah-rue-DAHS-anna)</i><br />Garuda = the mythic “king of the
          birds,” the vehicle of Vishnu. The word is usually rendered into
          English as “eagle,” though according to one dictionary the name
          literally means “devourer,” because Garuda was originally identified
          with the “all-consuming fire of the sun’s rays.”
